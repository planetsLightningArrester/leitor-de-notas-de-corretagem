2. Pick a meaningful title for your pull request!
  - Use sentence case. Keep it short. ex: `✨ refactor(users): add filters to manage users list view`
3. Enter a succinct description that says why the PR is necessary, and what it does.
  Examples of good descriptions:
  - Implement aspect of X

  - Improve performance by B
  - Improve accessibility by C
4. If the pull request addresses an issue, mention it with keywords `Fixes`, `Closes`, or `Resolves`.
  - Using one of the above keywords will automatically close the issue (ex: Fixes #17)
5. Make sure to assign the appropriate label(s) to the pull request!
6. Provide clear testing instructions that include any pertinent information, i.e. roles, feature flags, etc.)
7. Include screenshots of your changes if they impact the UI (Before & After).
